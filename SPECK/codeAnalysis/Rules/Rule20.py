RULE NÂ°21

+ Use telephony networking
** SMS is neither encrypted nor strongly authenticated
** SMS messages are transmitted as broadcast intents, so they may be read or captured by other applications that have the READ_SMS permission
-> https://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-tips#IPNetworking

? Pseudo Code:
	1. Look for SEND_SMS permission
	2. Look for READ_SMS or RECEIVE_SMS


! Output
	-> NOTHING	: no permission found
